<H4>1. Implement Brenhamâ€™s line drawing algorithm for all types of slope.</H4><BR>

<H4>2. Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.</H4><BR>

<H4>3.Program to draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices.</H4><BR>

<H4>4. Program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment with perspective viewing.</H4><BR>

<H4>5. Program to clip a lines using Cohen-Sutherland line-clipping algorithm.</H4><BR>

<H4>6. Program to draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a
table. Define suitably the position and properties of the light source along
with the properties of the properties of the surfaces of the solid object
used in the scene.</H4><BR>

<H4>7. Program to recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to from 3D Sierpinski
gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.</H4><BR>

<H4>8. Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier curve
algorithm.</H4><BR>

<H4>9. Develop a menu driven program to fill any given polygon using scanline area filling
algorithm.</H4><BR>
